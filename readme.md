Hello. This is a simple form website.
All the web pages is a HTML Form page for different entities or service - ranging from student/customer registration to search.
It is entirely built with HTML, so be forewarned: "there is no shiny stuff or fancy design".
I hope to style it and use some CSS in the subsequent release. 
So, lets just call this one version 1.0
